Capsicum Chinense var. ""habanero""

I made habanero chili and I then germinated the seeds from the peppers that I used, on a whim. I got a much higher germination rate than I expected I would have gotten, and therefore I have many more living plants than I can use. These plants are annuals, and they will grow large and produce many habaneros for you in a 5 gallon container, provided that you don't kill the plant with mistreatment. I have grown these before and I will give you any advice you need to grow them successfully. Please understand that I bought those peppers from which I saved seed from a grocery store, and if you've ever grown peppers before, you'll know that they are the most sexually promiscuous plants in a garden. They cross pollenate readily. So I can't guarantee that they are indeed orange habanero plants, but only that they do have orange hab as one parent. If you are interested, contact me at (214) 632 - 7680. Preferably via text message. If you indeed do take one of these plants, I will give you my habanero chili recipe. Alex."

* This is a ""maxed out"" version of the Macbook Pro 13 inch. There are no other options you can add unless you take a screwdriver to the laptop. *

The MBP 13 inch comes with an optical drive (Think CDs, DVDs).

It has no scratches whatsoever and comes with $50 hard shell black case from Incase (the one in the Norris book store) and a cheap $1 keyboard cover from ebay.

Will restore computer to factory condition and install ANY program you want prior to purchase. (Think Office, Pages, Keynote, Adobe Creative Suite, etc.)

Even willing to set up Bootcamp with Win7 or Win8 (and Virtual Machine to access your Bootcamp partition from within your Mac - Think VMWare Fusion).

Will upgrade to OSX Mavericks when it comes out for free if you like (or I can install the Developer Preview 7 - Better support for dual screen monitors and more http://www.apple.com/osx/preview/).

Will include pictures if you comment on this post or message me.

Attached is a link to Ebay listings for laptops with comparable specs.

I'm looking for around $1400 for the casing, software, custom configuration, and customer service that I offer but feel free to make an offer.

For any Mac virgins out there thinking about coming to the dark side this school year I'll help you make it a quick painless experience."

wraps for handlebars (not really necessary for a functioning bike)

Renting a car from a rental is too expensive because I'm only 20 and they add a surcharge for younger drivers.

A lot of thought and care went into designing this board, ladies and gentlemen: get it while it lasts!

Asking price is 200 (that is at cost, without the time and effort spent designing it.) It's a high quality board made with the best parts and meant specifically for cruising around campus. 

That means, it turns incredibly well (to avoid pedestrians/cyclists/the campus Fox), and is pretty small to remain portable.

Specs:
28x8'' maple board
Gullwing trucks -- dual kingpin for extra turn
1/8'' rubber risers to prevent wheel bite
61mm wheels, 78a duro for a soft ride

AMAZING battery life (10 hours minimum at full charge—it’s a 6-cell.) Upgraded to 2 GB RAM. 250 GB Hard Drive, Windows 7 Starter Edition (including Microsoft Word and Excel 2010 Starter Edition), dual-core 1.5 GHz processor. Webcam. Will come in original packaging with its charger (no user guide but I’ll include the user manual pdf on the desktop). LCD screen—NO GLARE. Matte blue—great textured shell so no greasy smudging.

It’s a few years old so it’s not as fast as a brand new computer, but it’s really well taken care of. I have a new 15.6” now so I don’t use this one anymore and would like it off my hands. Videos from streaming sites work great but I don’t watch much, it’s more for note-taking and easy transport. It advertises a 13 hour battery life but it’s around 2 years old so I get a good 9-10 hours on one charge which makes transporting it a breeze—no more being enslaved to the charger! I used it mostly to take notes in class. Like today it was on from 12-4 and only went down to 78%. Of course it varies with what you’re doing.

I prefer my 15.6” so this is usually turned off and on my desk other than the times I turn it on to update it and do some browsing or Spotify-listening (about twice a week). Everything is virus-free (I’m a freak about that, I have like 7 programs dedicated to keeping it clean) but I’m planning on completely restoring it and updating it (I’ve done it before, no risk) and reinstalling Microsoft Essentials or your choice of antivirus (Avast is my favorite) so it’ll come ready to use with no worries of viruses. If you like I’ll also include installed Dropbox, Spotify, necessary stuff like Adobe Reader and Firefox (or Chrome, you can let me know what you want), and the programs I’ve been using.

For a computer that’s a few years old yet in perfect physical shape, with upgraded RAM and an awesome battery life, I think $190’s a fair price (Amazon’s used ones are $225+) but I’m open to negotiation. Also best offer of course if you want to go higher. I’d do this on eBay but shipping and all that is a hassle. Sales are final so serious buyers only. Message me if you’re interested.

Here’re some reviews, and the official website which has specs if you want to know more.

I actually still need it until June 15th so you can message me on fb until then. You can have it earlier if you somehow convince me to walk to class (unlikely, but I will close the thread prior to June 15th if that happens). Message me if you'd like to test ride it. No refunds/returns, buying as is.

Some notes about the bike --
Both brakes are functional, it is labeled as having multiple gears and they somewhat work, the seat is intact (in the pic I just cover it with a shopping bag to protect from rain and heat while in the sun), the tires are in okay shape (the front tire occasionally flattens, but I've patched it so it should last awhile). Here's a picture of a panda I drew, in case you're still reading this. https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3999550191703&set=a.3651196203071.167215.1369481282&type=3&theater.
