I have grown these before and I will give you any advice you need to grow them successfully. Please understand that I bought those peppers from which I saved seed from a grocery store, and if you've ever grown peppers before, you'll know that they are the most sexually promiscuous plants in a garden. They cross pollenate readily. So I can't guarantee that they are indeed orange habanero plants, but only that they do have orange hab as one parent.

AMAZING battery life (10 hours minimum at full charge\\u2014it\\u2019s a 6-cell.) Upgraded to 2 GB RAM. 250 GB Hard Drive, Windows 7 Starter Edition (including Microsoft Word and Excel 2010 Starter Edition), dual-core 1.5 GHz processor. Webcam. Will come in original packaging with its charger (no user guide but I\\u2019ll include the user manual pdf on the desktop). LCD screen\\u2014NO GLARE. Matte blue\\u2014great textured shell so no greasy smudging.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a few years old so it\\u2019s not as fast as a brand new computer, but it\\u2019s really well taken care of. I have a new 15.6\\u201d now so I don\\u2019t use this one anymore and would like it off my hands. Videos from streaming sites work great but I don\\u2019t watch much, it\\u2019s more for note-taking and easy transport. It advertises a 13 hour battery life but it\\u2019s around 2 years old so I get a good 9-10 hours on one charge which makes transporting it a breeze\\u2014no more being enslaved to the charger! I used it mostly to take notes in class. Like today it was on from 12-4 and only went down to 78%. Of course it varies with what you\\u2019re doing.\\n\\nI prefer my 15.6\\u201d so this is usually turned off and on my desk other than the times I turn it on to update it and do some browsing or Spotify-listening (about twice a week). Everything is virus-free (I\\u2019m a freak about that, I have like 7 programs dedicated to keeping it clean) but I\\u2019m planning on completely restoring it and updating it (I\\u2019ve done it before, no risk) and reinstalling Microsoft Essentials or your choice of antivirus (Avast is my favorite) so it\\u2019ll come ready to use with no worries of viruses. If you like I\\u2019ll also include installed Dropbox, Spotify, necessary stuff like Adobe Reader and Firefox (or Chrome, you can let me know what you want), and the programs I\\u2019ve been using.\\n\\nFor a computer that\\u2019s a few years old yet in perfect physical shape, with upgraded RAM and an awesome battery life, I think $190\\u2019s a fair price (Amazon\\u2019s used ones are $225+) but I\\u2019m open to negotiation.

I got a much higher germination rate than I expected I would have gotten, and therefore I have many more living plants than I can use. These plants are annuals, and they will grow large and produce many habaneros for you in a 5 gallon container, provided that you don't kill the plant with mistreatment. I have grown these before and I will give you any advice you need to grow them successfully. Please understand that I bought those peppers from which I saved seed from a grocery store, and if you've ever grown peppers before, you'll know that they are the most sexually promiscuous plants in a garden. They cross pollenate readily. So I can't guarantee that they are indeed orange habanero plants, but only that they do have orange hab as one parent. If you are interested, contact me at (214) 632 - 7680. Preferably via text message. If you indeed do take one of these plants, I will give you my habanero chili recipe.

I got a much higher germination rate than I expected I would have gotten, and therefore I have many more living plants than I can use. These plants are annuals, and they will grow large and produce many habaneros for you in a 5 gallon container, provided that you don't kill the plant with mistreatment. I have grown these before and I will give you any advice you need to grow them successfully. Please understand that I bought those peppers from which I saved seed from a grocery store, and if you've ever grown peppers before, you'll know that they are the most sexually promiscuous plants in a garden. They cross pollenate readily. So I can't guarantee that they are indeed orange habanero plants, but only that they do have orange hab as one parent. If you are interested, contact me at (214) 632 - 7680. Preferably via text message. If you indeed do take one of these plants, I will give you my habanero chili recipe.

AMAZING battery life (10 hours minimum at full charge\\u2014it\\u2019s a 6-cell.) Upgraded to 2 GB RAM. 250 GB Hard Drive, Windows 7 Starter Edition (including Microsoft Word and Excel 2010 Starter Edition), dual-core 1.5 GHz processor. Webcam.

Matte blue\\u2014great textured shell so no greasy smudging.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a few years old so it\\u2019s not as fast as a brand new computer, but it\\u2019s really well taken care of. I have a new 15.6\\u201d now so I don\\u2019t use this one anymore and would like it off my hands. Videos from streaming sites work great but I don\\u2019t watch much, it\\u2019s more for note-taking and easy transport. It advertises a 13 hour battery life but it\\u2019s around 2 years old so I get a good 9-10 hours on one charge which makes transporting it a breeze\\u2014no more being enslaved to the charger!

Of course it varies with what you\\u2019re doing.\\n\\nI prefer my 15.6\\u201d so this is usually turned off and on my desk other than the times I turn it on to update it and do some browsing or Spotify-listening (about twice a week).

If you like I\\u2019ll also include installed Dropbox, Spotify, necessary stuff like Adobe Reader and Firefox (or Chrome, you can let me know what you want), and the programs I\\u2019ve been using.\\n\\nFor a computer that\\u2019s a few years old yet in perfect physical shape, with upgraded RAM and an awesome battery life, I think $190\\u2019s a fair price (Amazon\\u2019s used ones are $225+) but I\\u2019m open to negotiation.
