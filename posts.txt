Tired of the unreliability of Craigslist postings?
Enjoy purchasing methods that make you feel like a middle-aged adult at an Elementary school fundraising event? 

Well then I have the opportunity of a lifetime* for you!

This Thursday, October 9th, Norris Outdoors will be having a silent bike auction on the ground floor of Norris from 5:30pm-6:30pm!

Ok new sales pitch. @>@ 
Hey! Do you have an essay due tmrw like me? Do you have a midterm this Friday like me? Did you just find out you did bad on a recent quiz and need to study more like me? If you said yes to any of those questions, I advise you to stop reading this post right now. 
These two SCII games are in need of a loving and caring home where the owners will be loving and caring. Unfortunately, I can not offer them a haven of such due to the previously stated circumstances. Though money cannot measure love, a measly 30 bucks is all that I need to ensure that the new home they find will be financially stable enough to support them. 

As you can see it is a male and a female, brand spanking new. 

P.S. I'm pretty sure you need these two in order to play the new Protoss expansion pack which is coming out soon.

Ladies and gentlemen of NUF&FS: 

For your perusal is a fabulous Schwinn road bike. It rides like a dream and is freshly tuned up. The only slightly messy thing about it is the handlebars, and if you so choose, I will redo the bar tape for you for free. You'll just have to wait a day or so, since I ordered it off Amazon only last night.

This should fit you pretty well if you're between 5'5'' to 6', though obviously that varies based on your comfort level and proportions and other silly things like that.

ASKING: 200 OBO. It is 100% worth it, but don't take my word for it. Come by and test it out, just shoot me a message to set up a day/time.

Free: Houseplants

Capsicum Chinense var. "habanero"

I made habanero chili and I then germinated the seeds from the peppers that I used, on a whim. I got a much higher germination rate than I expected I would have gotten, and therefore I have many more living plants than I can use. These plants are annuals, and they will grow large and produce many habaneros for you in a 5 gallon container, provided that you don't kill the plant with mistreatment. I have grown these before and I will give you any advice you need to grow them successfully. Please understand that I bought those peppers from which I saved seed from a grocery store, and if you've ever grown peppers before, you'll know that they are the most sexually promiscuous plants in a garden. They cross pollenate readily. So I can't guarantee that they are indeed orange habanero plants, but only that they do have orange hab as one parent. If you are interested, contact me at (214) 632 - 7680. Preferably via text message. If you indeed do take one of these plants, I will give you my habanero chili recipe. Alex.

Selling two bikes. 

Mountain bike for 100, very solid, needs some air in the tires and brake adjustments which I promise I will get around to doing at some point. Fits someone up to about 5'8''. 

Road bike for 200. This is my baby--stripped, sanded, repainted, parts replaced, everything tuned and adjusted. Sometimes a bit rough around the edges, but otherwise she's a beautiful girl. Fits me fine at 5'8'', but if you're not used to a road bike, it might be big for you. I'd say you have to be at least 5'7'', and most comfortable would be around 5'9'' to 6'. 

I can attach a bike rack (a la http://www.amazon.com/Planet-Bike-Oversized-Aluminum-Pre-installed/dp/B000RYAKRC/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&qid=1411595244&sr=8-11&keywords=bike+rack) for $15.

55" inch JVC television. There is a wiring issue so the HDMI port is the only thing working for this TV. Sound and other ports DO NOT work. TV works perfectly as a projector - hook up a laptop and connect the TV to a speaker system and you have a great big-screen. If you're good with electronics and old projector-style TVs then this is a great buy. I replaced the lamp last year and that will last another few years. I would need you to come and pick up the TV; stand is not included. $50; PM if interested. Thanks!

For sale: White 1995 Toyota Camry, asking $1000 in cash
 
Car biography
The car has been in Chicago for 1 year, before that it spent its entire life in southern California. The dry weather and lack of salted roads during winter means that LA is a super car friendly place, and as a result the car body is in very good condition for its age. It has ~178,000 miles, but has had regular maintenance and oil changes, and continues to run well.

Known problems:
-Slow leak in power steering fluid. Power steering fluid costs ~$5 for a bottle that will last you for 3-6 months.
-A few very minor dings and scratches; no substantial rust damage
 
Recent work:
-Battery replaced last winter
-New windshield wipers last spring
Vehicle service record available.

Send me a message if interested. I am happy to provide more pictures and details available upon request.
